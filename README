Orbits is a simple code for solving direct n-body problems.  It is
designed to make comparing different ODE integrators easy.  The
current version includes 6 integrators.  They are

	1st-order:	Forward Euler			[Euler]
			Drift-kick modified Euler	[DK]
			Kick-drift modified Euler	[KD]
	2nd-order:	Drift-kick-drift leapfrog	[DKD]
			Kick-drift-kick  leapfrog	[KDK]
	4th-order:	Chin (1997) algorithm C		[ChinC]

All these integrators, except [Euler], are symplectic.  They preserve
the Hamiltonian structures of the n-body systems and provide excellent
conservation properties of energy.

To get started, simply run

	bin/compare tests/circle

in "orbits/".  The bash script "bin/compare" compiles and starts
orbits with all six integrators.  The timing results will be printed
on the screen once the calculations are done.  The output can be
plotted by the IDL scripts in "tools/".
